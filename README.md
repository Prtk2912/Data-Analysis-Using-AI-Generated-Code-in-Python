## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- jupyter

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy jupyter
```

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv data_analysis_env
source data_analysis_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `data_analysis_env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Activate the virtual environment (if used)
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open `Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb` in your browser
6. Run the cells to see the analysis

## Data Analysis Steps

1. Data Acquisition and Loading
2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
   - Handling missing values
   - Converting categorical variables
3. Data Analysis and Visualization
   - Overall survival rate
   - Survival by gender
   - Survival by passenger class
   - Age distribution analysis
   - Family size impact on survival
4. Drawing Insights
5. Creating Summary Visualizations

## Key Findings

1. Gender significantly influenced survival rates, with females having a higher chance of survival.
2. Passengers in higher classes (1st and 2nd) had better survival rates compared to those in 3rd class.
3. Children and young adults had higher survival rates compared to older adults.
4. Passengers traveling with small families (2-4 members) had higher survival rates compared to those traveling alone or with large families.

## Further Analysis

Potential areas for deeper investigation:
- Perform statistical tests to confirm observations
- Create a predictive model for survival based on passenger characteristics
- Investigate other variables like 'Fare' or 'Embarked' and their relationship with survival
